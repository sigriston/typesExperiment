# typesExperiment
> Some experimentation with [fp-ts], [io-ts] and friends

I created this repo to play around with some of the hottest functional
programming packages for TypeScript: [fp-ts] and [io-ts].

My focus here was on runtime type validation for stuff like JSON payloads.

## Development setup

Just install all packages with [yarn] then run tests:

```sh
yarn
yarn test
```
